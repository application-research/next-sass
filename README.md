## DEPRECATION NOTICE

This template is no longer up to date. For an updated template, either as a team or individually, we encourage you to explore our [latest template](https://github.com/internet-development/nextjs-sass-starter) produced by [INTDEV](https://internet.dev). Thank you for your interest in our work! 

# NEXT-SASS

Why would I use this?

- Quickly start a project with TypeScript, SASS, and NextJS.
- Convenient global CSS reset file.
- You got tired of using CSS-in-JS.
- You want to make a website quickly.

### Setup (MacOS)

Start by cloning the repository, or by clicking on **Use this template** above.

Then run the server

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Go to `http://localhost:3005` in your browser of choice. Enjoy!

### Scripts

If you need to run node script without running the server, use this example to get started

```sh
npm run script example
```

### Env Variables

If you want to connect to a Postgres database, something I do all the time, provide the following `.env` file. `5432` is the default Postgres port.

```sh
DOCUMENT_DATABASE_NAME=xxxx
DOCUMENT_DATABASE_USERNAME=xxxx
DOCUMENT_DATABASE_HOST=xxxx
DOCUMENT_DATABASE_PORT=5432
DOCUMENT_DATABASE_PASSWORD=xxxx
```
